In this project report, we propose an algorithm to rate articles based on parameters that were gathered by the study of human dynamics towards literature. Our algorithm gives higher rating to an article rich in metaphorical and grandiloquent word usage. It requires only the WordNet and Google NGram toolkit. We have provided empirical test results in the report. We also present issues that make the identification and extraction of metaphors a tough quest in general.
